# Econometrics

This repository contains practices in econometric, time series regression and statistical 
modeling techniques. In developing these skills, I utilize R to perform the regressions but 
the data will be collected through Python either by webscraping or api requests. Additionally,
some of the data will be randomly generated.

My goal is to learn about techniques that I can eventually use in future projects. I would very
much appreciate assistant or guidance in learning these subjects, so I encourage connecting to my linkedin
or emailing.
